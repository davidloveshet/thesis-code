# thesis-code

--项目介绍--

This repository includes the codes for generating data of thesis. 

Due to the five-year span that these codes have undergone, and given the limited time available, it is difficult to annotate the codes within a short timeframe. But we provide a general and clear overview of the code structure and functionality. Please note that if you have any questions, you can feel free to contact me, we would like to offer concrete feedback. 

If you find any typos, please feel free to contact us and we would like to correct errors promptly.
