# thesis-code

--项目介绍--

This repository includes the codes for generating the data of the thesis.

Due to the five-year duration of the whole process and given the limited time, it is difficult to annotate all codes in detailes within a short time. However, we have tried our best to provide a general and clear overview of the code structure and functionality. Therefore, if you have any questions about the code, please feel free to contact me and we appreciate the feedback.

If you find any typos, please also feel free to contact us and we would like to correct them promptly.
